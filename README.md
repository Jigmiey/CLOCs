# CLOCs
For 3D object recognition, mainly three kinds of fusion can be done which are early, intermediate and late fusion.  Camera Lidar Object Candidates' Fusion (CLOCs) is late fusion that allows great flexibility for modifications and evaluations. 
Here, CLOCs for 3D Object Detection network is used and a compreshensive study of fusion architecture and detection framework is done. This study is conducted using the KITTI  training set and test results were produced based on the KITTI validation set.
