# CLOCs
For 3D object recognition, mainly three kinds of fusion can be done which are early, intermediate and late fusion.  Camera Lidar Object Candidates' Fusion (CLOCs) is a late fusion technique that combines 2D (from Camera)and 3D detectors(from Lidar) proposals and improve the detection results. 
Here, CLOCs for 3D Object Detection network is used and a comprehensive study of different fusion network is done. This study is conducted using the KITTI training set and test results were produced based on the KITTI validation set.
